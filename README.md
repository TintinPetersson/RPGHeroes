# RPG Heroes

- I created a C# console application that displays heroes with different attributes, equipment and level in the console. The main function of the program is unit testing.

## Features include:

- Hero class with 4 subclasses: Mage, Ranger, Rogue and Warrior.

- Item/Equipment for the speicifc hero. 4 slots. Weapon, Head, Body and Legs.

- Item has 2 subclasses. Armor and weapon.

- Functions to calculate Damage, Equip a Weapon, Equip a Armor piece, Level Up and to Display all of the attributes of a Hero.

- 35 Unit tests to test functionality of each of the above mentioned methods and classes.

Enjoy!
